## Highgraph integration with ReactJS
Kimagure wrote an article about integration of [HighCharts](http://highcharts.com) with [ReactJS](http://facebook.github.io/react/) at [http://qiita.com/kimagure/items/c446a1d644a2b0c35c93](). The article refers to a [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/) showing a demo of the concept at [http://jsfiddle.net/kimagure/UP2Qd/3/]().

The demo shows a chart using a static series model defined in the JavaScript file. I decided to try to load the series model dynamically, from a remote service. This concept is shown in a JSFiddle found at [http://jsfiddle.net/edvinsson/3109zf01/](), which is a fork of [http://jsfiddle.net/kimagure/UP2Qd/3/]().
